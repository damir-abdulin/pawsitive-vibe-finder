## User Story 7: Enjoy the Application in Preferred Visual Mode (Dark Theme)

**AS A** user
**I WANT TO** be able to switch between a light and dark visual theme
**SO THAT I** can use the application comfortably in various lighting conditions and according to my personal preference.

**Preconditions:**
* PRE-DT-1: The application is running.

**Acceptance Criteria (Dark Theme Support):**
* AC-DT-1: The system shall provide a mechanism for the user to switch between a light and dark theme.
    * AC-DT-1.1: This mechanism shall be accessible from the navigation drawer (as per User Story 5: Navigate Through the Application, AC-NAV-4.3.1).
    * AC-DT-1.2: The light and dark themes shall be defined using a centralized theme configuration within the application (e.g., Flutter's `ThemeData`) to ensure consistency and maintainability.
* AC-DT-2: When the dark theme is active, all application UI elements (backgrounds, text, icons, AppBars, dialogs, etc.) shall update to a darker, coherent color palette designed for low-light environments.
* AC-DT-3: When the light theme is active, all application UI elements shall use a lighter, coherent color palette suitable for well-lit environments.
* AC-DT-4: The selected theme preference (light, dark, or system default if implemented) shall persist across app launches (e.g., using `shared_preferences`).
* AC-DT-5: Text and icons shall maintain sufficient contrast against their backgrounds in both light and dark themes to ensure readability and usability, adhering to accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG AA contrast ratios).

## User Story 8: View Content Even Without Connectivity (Offline Mode/Caching)

**AS A** user
**I WANT TO** be able to view previously fetched dog breeds and images
**SO THAT I** can continue enjoying the application even when my internet connection is unreliable or unavailable.

**Preconditions:**
* PRE-OFF-1: The user has previously launched the application with an active internet connection at least once to allow for initial data fetching and caching.
* PRE-OFF-2: The application has implemented local storage capabilities (e.g., `drift` for structured data like breed lists/favorites, `cached_network_image` for images, `shared_preferences` for simple flags).

**Acceptance Criteria (Offline Mode / API Response Caching):**

* **AC-OFF-1: Breed List Caching (related to User Story 1):**
    * AC-OFF-1.1: The system shall cache the defined list of all dog breeds (as per User Story 1, Appendix A) after it's successfully populated.
    * AC-OFF-1.2: When the BreedListPage (User Story 1) is accessed without an internet connection, it shall load and display the breed list from the local cache if available.
    * AC-OFF-1.3: Search functionality on the BreedListPage shall work with the cached breed list when offline.
    * AC-OFF-1.4: When displaying the cached breed list on the BreedListPage in an offline or potentially stale data scenario, the system should display a "last updated" timestamp for that list, if this information is tracked and available.

* **AC-OFF-2: Image Caching (related to User Story 0, User Story 2):**
    * AC-OFF-2.1: The system shall cache a reasonable number of previously viewed dog images using a library like `cached_network_image`, including those displayed on the BreedImagePage (User Story 2) and the Home Screen's random image (User Story 0).
    * AC-OFF-2.2: When offline and navigating to the Home Screen (User Story 0 subsequent launch), a previously viewed and cached random image may be displayed if fetching a new one fails or is not attempted.
    * AC-OFF-2.3: When offline and navigating to a previously viewed breed's BreedImagePage (User Story 2), a cached image for that breed (if available from a previous viewing) should be displayed if fetching a new one is not possible.
    * AC-OFF-2.4: Swiping for new images on the Home Screen (User Story 0) or BreedImagePage (User Story 2) while offline will result in a popup prompting the user to connect to the internet (as defined in their respective ACs).

* **AC-OFF-3: Favorite Images (related to User Story 3):**
    * AC-OFF-3.1: Favorite images (image URLs or identifiers) are stored locally and shall be viewable on the FavoritesPage (User Story 3) when offline, provided the images themselves were previously viewed and cached by the image loading library.
    * AC-OFF-3.2: Marking/unmarking favorites on the FavoritesPage can occur offline, with changes persisted locally.

* **AC-OFF-4: Recently Viewed Breeds (related to User Story 4):**
    * AC-OFF-4.1: The list of recently viewed breeds is stored locally and shall be accessible offline.

* **AC-OFF-5: Offline Indication and Behavior:**
    * AC-OFF-5.1: If an online action (e.g., fetching a new, non-cached image) fails due to lack of connectivity, the application shall display an appropriate error message (as defined in specific feature user stories or a general network error message).
    * AC-OFF-5.2: Actions that inherently require an internet connection and have no cached alternative should either be clearly disabled or clearly inform the user of the offline status and the need for a connection upon attempting the action.

* **AC-OFF-6: Cache Management:**
    * AC-OFF-6.1: The caching mechanism for images should have a strategy for managing cache size and eviction (e.g., based on Least Recently Used, or configurable limits provided by the `cached_network_image` library).
    * AC-OFF-6.2: The cached breed list (defined list) should have a strategy for updates when the app is back online (e.g., on next app launch with internet, or via a manual refresh action if such a feature is implemented for list updates).

**Message Requirements (Offline Mode - General):**
* M-OFF-1: General message if an online action cannot be completed due to no connection and no cached data/alternative is available: e.g., "You're offline. Please connect to the internet to use this feature."
* M-OFF-2: (Optional) A subtle, non-intrusive global indicator if the app is operating in a significantly degraded offline mode.

## User Story 9: Engage with Fluid and Visually Appealing Interactions (Animations)

**AS A** user
**I WANT TO** experience smooth and visually appealing transitions and interactions within the app
**SO THAT I** feel the app is modern, polished, and responsive.

**Preconditions:**
* PRE-ANIM-1: The application is running on a device capable of rendering animations smoothly.
* PRE-ANIM-2: The Flutter framework and chosen UI components support the specified animation capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria (Animations):**

* **AC-ANIM-1: Image Loading Animations:**
    * AC-ANIM-1.1: Images displayed on the Home Screen (User Story 0), BreedImagePage (User Story 2), and within the FavoritesPage grid (User Story 3) shall use a subtle fade-in animation as they load and appear.

* **AC-ANIM-2: Page Transitions:**
    * AC-ANIM-2.1: Transitions between primary screens (e.g., HomePage, BreedListPage, BreedImagePage, FavoritesPage) shall utilize smooth, platform-appropriate page transition animations.
    * AC-ANIM-2.2: Transitions should be consistent unless a specific type of transition is chosen to convey hierarchy or a special relationship.
    * AC-ANIM-2.3: Consider using Hero animations for image transitions where appropriate, such as navigating from a list item with an image thumbnail (if implemented on BreedListPage) to a detail view displaying the same image (e.g., to BreedImagePage).

* **AC-ANIM-3: Loading Indicator Animations:**
    * AC-ANIM-3.1: The appearance and disappearance of `CircularProgressIndicator` (or similar loading indicators) shall be animated (e.g., fade-in/fade-out) rather than abruptly appearing/disappearing, where feasible.

* **AC-ANIM-4: List Item Animations:**
    * AC-ANIM-4.1: The filtering of the BreedListPage (User Story 1) when typing in the search bar should have a smooth animation for list item appearance/disappearance or reordering (e.g., using `AnimatedList`).
    * AC-ANIM-4.2: When list items appear (e.g., initial load of BreedListPage or FavoritesPage), consider using subtle staggered entrance animations for a more polished feel.

* **AC-ANIM-5: Interactive Element Feedback:**
    * AC-ANIM-5.1: Tappable elements like buttons, list items, and icons should have subtle press/tap feedback animations (e.g., ripple effect).
    * AC-ANIM-5.2: The opening and closing of the navigation drawer shall be smoothly animated.
    * AC-ANIM-5.3: Swipe gestures (e.g., on images in User Story 0 and User Story 2) should feel natural and responsive, with the swiped element tracking the user's finger and animating smoothly.

* **AC-ANIM-6: General Animation Properties:**
    * AC-ANIM-6.1: All animations shall be subtle and purposeful, enhancing the user experience without causing distraction, significant delays, or performance degradation.
    * AC-ANIM-6.2: Animations should perform smoothly across a range of target devices.
    * AC-ANIM-6.3: Animations should be interruptible or complete quickly where appropriate.
