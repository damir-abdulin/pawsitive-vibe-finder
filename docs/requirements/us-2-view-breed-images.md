## User Story 2: View All Images for a Specific Dog Breed in a Performant, Interactive Slideshow

### User Story

**AS A** user
**I WANT TO** browse all images for a selected breed in a seamless, looping slideshow that works even when I'm offline (for previously viewed breeds), with the ability to zoom in and use a thumbnail gallery
**SO THAT I** can enjoy a fast, uninterrupted, and deeply engaging exploration of my favorite dog breeds anytime, anywhere.

### Preconditions

| ID | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| PRE-1 | The user has successfully navigated to the BreedListPage. |
| PRE-2 | The device can determine its current network connectivity status (online/offline). |
| PRE-3 | The API endpoint to retrieve all images for a specific breed is available and responsive when the device is online. |
| PRE-4 | The application has been granted the necessary permissions to write to and read from local device storage for caching. |
| PRE-5 |  For offline functionality, the user must have previously viewed the gallery for a specific breed while online, allowing its data to be cached. |

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Core Slideshow Functionality

| ID | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| AC-1 | Upon selecting a breed, the system shall transition to the slideshow screen. The screen's AppBar will display the breed's name and a back button. |
| AC-2 | The main image display will allow navigation via left/right swipes and on-screen "Next"/"Previous" buttons. |
| AC-3 | The slideshow interface will display a gallery counter (e.g., "Image 5 of 20") and a "Favorite" (heart) icon for the current image. |
| AC-4 | **(Updated)** The slideshow shall loop continuously. |
| AC-4.1 | Upon reaching the last image, a left swipe or press of the "Next" button shall navigate the slideshow to the first image. |
| AC-4.2 | When viewing the first image, a right swipe or press of the "Previous" button shall navigate the slideshow to the last image. |

#### Interactive Features

| ID | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| AC-5 | The user can zoom into the main image using a pinch-to-zoom gesture and pan the zoomed image by dragging. Swipe navigation is disabled while zoomed. |
| AC-6 | A horizontally scrollable thumbnail gallery is displayed. The thumbnail for the current image is visually highlighted, and tapping a thumbnail navigates to that image. |

#### System Behavior, Performance, and Offline Capability

| ID | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| AC-7 | **(New) Lazy Loading:** To ensure fast initial load times and efficient data usage, the system will implement lazy loading. |
| AC-7.1 | When the slideshow screen is first opened, only the data and thumbnails for the initially visible portion of the thumbnail strip (plus a small buffer) will be fetched and rendered. |
| AC-7.2 | Full-resolution images and subsequent thumbnails will only be loaded as they are about to be displayed in the viewport. Placeholders will be shown for content that is still loading. |
| AC-8 | **(New) Caching Strategy:** The application will cache viewed images and gallery data to improve performance and enable offline access. |
| AC-8.1 | All viewed full-resolution images and their corresponding thumbnails will be saved to the device's local cache. |
| AC-8.2 | The cache will have a maximum size limit (e.g., 250 MB). If the limit is exceeded, the system will automatically remove the least recently used assets (LRU policy). |
| AC-8.3 | The application settings shall include an option for the user to manually clear the entire image cache. |
| AC-9 | **(New) Offline Capability:** The application will provide functionality based on its network status and cached data. |
| AC-9.1 | If the user selects a breed that has been previously viewed and is in the cache while offline, the slideshow shall open and be fully functional, using the cached images and thumbnails. |
| AC-9.2 | If the user selects a breed that has **not** been cached while offline, the system will not proceed to the slideshow. Instead, it will display a message indicating the lack of internet connection and the need to be online to view new content. |
